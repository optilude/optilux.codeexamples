Examples of object containment
==============================

First, we create a ``Document`` object with id ``guitars``. We ignore the
return value.
    
    >>> from plone.app.testing import setRoles
    >>> from plone.app.testing import TEST_USER_NAME
    
    >>> portal = layer['portal']
    
    >>> setRoles(portal, TEST_USER_NAME, ('Manager',))

    >>> _ = portal.invokeFactory('Document', 'favorites', title=u"Favorite guitars")

Then, let's verify that it is inside the object:

    >>> 'favorites' in portal
    True
    
We can now retrieve the object, using dictionary notation:

    >>> obj = portal['favorites']
    >>> obj.getId()
    'favorites'
    
We can also also use the ``aq_parent`` function to verify that the object
knows its parent:

    >>> from Acquisition import aq_parent
    >>> aq_parent(obj) is portal
    True
    >>> obj.aq_parent is portal
    True
    
In fact, when looking for the containment parent, it is safer to use
``aq_inner``, which makes sure we get the innermost acquisition chain:

    >>> from Acquisition import aq_inner
    >>> containment_parent = aq_parent(aq_inner(obj))
    >>> also_containment_parent = obj.aq_inner.aq_parent
    >>> containment_parent is also_containment_parent
    True
