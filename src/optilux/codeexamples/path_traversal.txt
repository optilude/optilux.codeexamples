Examples of path traversal
==========================

Explicit traversal starts at an object and uses a path-like expression. To
invoke path traversal in Python code, we can use methods
``unrestrictedTraverse()`` and ``restrictedTraverse()``, which are available
on most content objects.

``unrestrictedTraverse()`` is faster, since it does not take security into
account. ``restrictedTraverse()`` explicitly checks whether the current user
is allowed to access each element being traversed to. (This is how path
traversal works for templates or scripts created through-the-web or in CMF
skin layers.)
    
    >>> from plone.app.testing import setRoles
    >>> from plone.app.testing import TEST_USER_NAME
    
    >>> portal = layer['portal']
    
    >>> setRoles(portal, TEST_USER_NAME, ('Manager',))
    
    >>> _ = portal.invokeFactory('Folder', 'guitars')
    >>> _ = portal['guitars'].invokeFactory('Document', 'fender')
    
    >>> portal.unrestrictedTraverse('guitars/fender')
    <ATDocument at /plone/guitars/fender>
    
The 'plone' part of the path refers to the Plone instance that is set up by
the testing layer.
    
    >>> fenderPath = '/'.join(portal['guitars']['fender'].getPhysicalPath())
    >>> fenderPath
    '/plone/guitars/fender'
    
    >>> portal.unrestrictedTraverse(fenderPath)
    <ATDocument at /plone/guitars/fender>
